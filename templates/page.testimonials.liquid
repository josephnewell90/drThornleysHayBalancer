  <p class="mainTestimonial">"As a professional trainer, my livelihood depends on healthy horses that can perform year-round. I use Dr. Thornley's Hay Balancer as the nutritional supplement of choice in my barn. All of my horses and most of my clients' horses receive Hay Balancer daily as a key component of their alfalfa-based diets. Because I know the horses I train and show have all the nutrients they need without being overfed, I can count on them being strong, healthy, level-headed and performing like they should day-in and day-out."</p>
